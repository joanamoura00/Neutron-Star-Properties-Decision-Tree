# Neutron-Star-Properties-Decision-Tree

The aim of this project is to use machine learning models to establish a relationship between neutron star properties and the properties of nuclear matter at saturation density.
Based on observed records of star properties, we intend to establish linear or non-linear relationships between the properties of the equation of state of nuclear matter.
